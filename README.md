# WCAG-in-Plain-Language
A simple "Go To" for web developers & accessibility assessors.

The official [documentation of WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa) can be hard to understand and intimidating. The goal of WCAG in Plain Language is to provide a _quick, easy and simple_ way to lookup if a situation is a failure or not, including best practices and tips. 

This tool was created by Accessibility Specialists at [Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) and was born from a need in Accessibility auditing. It is free to use, open to edit and licensed MIT. Read [our LICENSE](https://github.com/MaximPerry/GrayScaleFilter-WebPlugin/blob/master/LICENSE) to know more.
